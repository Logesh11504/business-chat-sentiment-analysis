4/30/24, 3:31 PM - Person 4: @⁨Person 3⁩ I would like to remind you your deliveries are getting late. I have been waiting for an update from Person 2 to dispatch the last lot of the dyed Futa by the 5th and still no update from him. 
Let me remind you the delivery date given on the PO is ex fty Delhi. You are running late and my accounts team will levy a debit so please be aware.
4/30/24, 3:44 PM - Person 7: Please let me add here that the end result of a debit is not desire but rather used to cover the costs of deploying extra manpower and resources to ensure we provide the buyer with a quality, timely delivery. We are not in a position to take any debits as we get debited on the entire PO, not just the fabric, such as in your case. That amount is too large thus making us take out the shipment with unplanned and extraneous resources. 

Please deliver in time so our further processes don’t get hampered and force us to incur additional costs.
4/30/24, 3:45 PM - Person 4: <Media omitted>
4/30/24, 3:45 PM - Person 4: This schedule received by Person 2 is not acceptable. The last date for the dyed pieces to be 5.5.24 and further delay please air the shipment at your cost 
4/30/24, 3:49 PM - Person 2: I am in Nandhinee textile only.  We are not working with huge profit to absorb any debits. 

Hope you understand our practical difficulties.
4/30/24, 3:51 PM - Person 4: <Media omitted>
4/30/24, 3:52 PM - Person 4: This is the delivery schedule you have for the new order, delivery dates are ex fty Delhi. Please keep that in mind
4/30/24, 3:54 PM - Person 7: Well that will leave us with two possible outcomes:
1. Cancelling goods beyond ship dates
2. ⁠Us having to deploy more capital to take out shipments which would result in slight hiccups in payments. 
This would qualify under “practical difficulties” 

You cannot hold a party accountable without being accountable yourselves. It is a two way street. 
We are only expecting out of you what you expect out of us. Both need to be line with one another as no one will give more than they’re receiving, in business.
4/30/24, 3:56 PM - Person 7: Rest I will discuss with @⁨Person 3⁩ 
Please feel free to call if you need any further clarifications
4/30/24, 3:57 PM - Person 2: Sir during our visit to your office, we revised the delivery date which is mentioned in P.O.
4/30/24, 3:58 PM - Person 4: Let me check
4/30/24, 3:59 PM - Person 4: Yes they are revised so ensure the deliveries reach our fty on those dates
4/30/24, 4:00 PM - Person 2: Ok sir.

4/30/24, 4:05 PM - Person 4: The softness level is not good, the pieces are rough as compared to the samples given to you to follow
4/30/24, 4:06 PM - Person 2: We can match the quality during bulk production.
4/30/24, 4:07 PM - Person 4: Buyer will not release order without approving the samples
5/1/24, 11:18 AM - Person 4: Good morning,

5/1/24, 11:36 AM - Person 3: Had a discussion with Sanjeet sir yesterday and explained the practical difficulties which we are going through in the manufacturing and processing unit due to over heat.
5/1/24, 11:38 AM - Person 7: Yes, we certainly had a discussion and while I understand your issues, I cannot be held responsible for the same. We can manage with a day or two delay, but nothing that will impact my deliveries to the Buyer. We are not responsible for manufacturing your goods, you are thus you are profiting from it therefore you need to take the responsibility of doing so.
5/1/24, 11:38 AM - Person 3: And we are in a process to streamline the all delivery schedules.
5/1/24, 11:39 AM - Person 7: I would suggest to reallocate because we have to deliver to the buyer irrespective of practical difficulties as well as processing unit due to over heat 
These are problems that you need to handle and cannot be passed onto us, your client
5/1/24, 11:43 AM - Person 2: Ok sir.  Will plan suitably and maintain the delivery as assured.
5/1/24, 11:45 AM - Person 3: Om

Refer our telecon.

As explained, the contamination is very very minor and this is the best possible quality without doing dyeing in Natural Fouta towels.   If we add more chemical to avoid contamination, the towel becomes white. 

 As you well aware, if we go with dyeing,  we  can match any of your customer's required colour but the dyeing cost will be additional and the dyed towel cost will be Rs.49.00 per Piece for Natural Fouta Towel.

Please do the needful to convince the buyers and get us the approval of this quality.  We already taken various types of experiment to avoid this much of minor contamination.

We will wait till your customers comments.

4/17/25, 8:15 PM - Person 7: Clearly there have been hurdles here. Why is it that we need to struggle to get your deliveries? I can’t have my team work any faster to get your goods received, printed, stitched and packed.

As someone who handles the production for SanDiya, I will be crystal clear in one thing - I, nor my team, will work twice as hard just because your fabric is late. I will simply cancel that style and you can keep the goods. 

It would be best if you could maintain the schedule which you, under no duress, confirmed to us.
4/19/25, 2:06 PM - Person 2: Sir as already told, we are going to execute the despatch every alternate day and the schedule will be kept in line before this month end.

5/20/25, 6:52 PM - Person 2: Yesterday 23520 pcs n today 15360 pcs.  Total 38880 pcs
5/20/25, 6:56 PM - Person 4: Please don’t count waffle futa in the total qty you confirmed 40k of the white futa
5/20/25, 6:57 PM - Person 2: Ok sir.
5/22/25, 12:15 PM - Person 4: Good afternoon,
Where is the next delivery???
5/22/25, 12:16 PM - Person 4: You are running very behind on your deliveries and I don’t see any possible way to complete all balance pieces for the 250k white futa by the end of this month??
5/22/25, 12:26 PM - Person 2: Good Afternoon sir 
I will come back later today.
5/22/25, 8:11 PM - Person 4: Still awaiting response??
5/22/25, 8:24 PM - Person 3: Good evening sir
5/22/25, 8:27 PM - Person 3: Since you have asked half white fouta on urgent basis, we have changed looms program to complete the quantity within the given timeframe.
5/22/25, 8:27 PM - Person 3: by tomorrow morning 12 pm will give you an update for white fouta
5/22/25, 8:28 PM - Person 4: I’m sorry but this excuse is not acceptable for any delay in the white futa
5/22/25, 8:37 PM - Person 3: Loom programs are bit complicated sir, to fulfill your urgent requirement we have changed the existing chart and started weaving for half white. otherwise we would have delivered 15k white fouta, please understand our situation and support us sir.
5/22/25, 8:37 PM - Person 3: tomorrow 12 PM will give a proper update for white fouta
5/22/25, 8:40 PM - Person 7: You do understand that the updates are absolutely trivial, correct?
This is the four or fifth “update” you are giving. Every update is different and moreover, all previous updates haven’t held true. 
Every time we ask you for an update, it just a further delayed schedule and commitments which till date have not held true. 
We can sum them up to be false promises. 

Every one has a breaking point and you are truly getting close to ours with the way that you are working. Don’t let the rubber band snap would be my suggestion. <This message was edited>
5/23/25, 12:09 PM - Person 4: @⁨Person 3⁩ awaiting response?
5/23/25, 12:09 PM - Person 3: Good morning sir
5/23/25, 12:12 PM - Person 3: Analyzed looms position and working on it sir, will share the details shortly.
5/23/25, 12:49 PM - Person 2: <Media omitted>
5/23/25, 1:11 PM - Person 4: This delivery schedule is not acceptable at all. By accepting an order for 50K half white does not mean you can push the delivery date of the white out by 30 days. The final date as per your original schedule is 30.5.2025. As it is you were running late in the deliveries and now you want to take the excuse of the half white to push the date out by 30 days.
5/23/25, 1:37 PM - Person 2: <Media omitted>
5/23/25, 1:39 PM - Person 4: This is not acceptable as well. The last dispatch date for the balance white futa to be 10.6.2025 and not a day beyond that.
5/23/25, 1:39 PM - Person 4: I suggest you rework your looms and add additional looms if need be and complete the qty on schedule. <This message was edited>
5/23/25, 1:41 PM - Person 2: Ok sir.  I will discuss with Mr.Person 2 n come back.

6/5/25, 10:56 AM - Person 7: Yea, let’s skip that nonsense and ensure you deliver as per this schedule. Your constant lieing and failing of commitments it’s becoming a bit too much. It’s putting a very big strain on our working relationship.
6/5/25, 10:59 AM - Person 7: You sent this 48 hours ago. If you don’t have your word or commitment, you should not do business. If you can find a word apart from constant failing of commitments to explain how you are working, I would like to hear it. It nothing apart from you sending excels with plan of dispatch and then deviating from it.
You’ve sent five or six plans, all which you keep changing. There’s almost no any value in what you’re saying anymore.
6/5/25, 11:03 AM - Person 2: Sir, please don't get angry.  It's only 10 days lack from our First schedule.  We are doing necessary things to keep the second schedule.

Thanks for your understanding.
6/5/25, 11:04 AM - Person 7: Not angry at all. Just surprised regarding your working style. And your performance.

6/9/25, 3:32 PM - Person 2: Good Afternoon sir 
Due to local festival holiday, little delay in the despatches.
Tomorrow we will despatch.
6/9/25, 3:33 PM - Person 7: You were supposed to ship 41,000 of which you only sent 12,000
6/9/25, 3:34 PM - Person 7: This was your commitment on Thursday of which you only sent 12,000 out of the 28,000
6/9/25, 3:35 PM - Person 7: Then after that, 13000 more was to be sent yesterday
6/9/25, 3:36 PM - Person 7: I’m seriously just beyond frustrated with whatever you call this nonsense practice of “working” 
It is simply so beyond my understanding that you really cannot commit to anything
6/9/25, 3:40 PM - Person 2: Saturday - Bakrid
Today - Lord Murugan festival

Both affected the despatches but we planned to bye pass this lack within this week.

Sorry for the trouble.
6/9/25, 3:41 PM - Person 7: No trouble, it’s called planning. Guess it was my mistake thinking you know how to do the same.
6/9/25, 3:42 PM - Person 7: Here are the dates for both festivals for the next 5 years

6/9/25, 3:42 PM - Person 7: It’s laughable at how you think these holidays just “pop up”
6/9/25, 3:43 PM - Person 7: Even more worrisome you didn’t know about these festivals when you made the schedule a few days prior
6/9/25, 3:45 PM - Person 7: This physically won’t be possible. It’s becoming impossible to work with your delays. 
Only option I have left is to only release payment when you hit milestones. 
No payment will be released till you deliver atleast another 50,000 units.
6/9/25, 3:46 PM - Person 7: Prior to the that, won’t be able to do so. 

Sorry for the trouble it may cause.

7/23/25, 5:01 PM - Person 3: Good evening sir
7/23/25, 5:08 PM - Person 2: Good Evening sir 

Bale weight is Approx 55 - 56 kgs.

They are charging 60 kg per bale as measurement weight.  When we asked with them, they told that, they already discussed with your office on this.
7/23/25, 5:11 PM - Person 4: Going forward I will not be paying for cartage. The price of 44/- per piece will be for delivery to the factory.
7/23/25, 5:13 PM - Person 2: Sir,  The Price of Rs.44/- is ex-factory price.  Please discuss with transporter for freight rates.
7/23/25, 5:14 PM - Person 4: I will not be paying for freight for any future orders, the freight will be to your account. I will move the business elsewhere as the cost is very high
7/23/25, 5:18 PM - Person 2: Sir, Rs.44/- ex-factory is the best Price from outside.   Lorry freight will not be in our account.
7/23/25, 5:22 PM - Person 4: Ok thanks we will be placing future orders with another vendor
7/23/25, 6:25 PM - Person 2: Sir, since we are getting regular order, we are running this item with very very low margin.  Kindly support us.  Thanks. <This message was edited>
7/23/25, 6:26 PM - Person 4: I need a price of futa in running meter without the gap in between. Please quote price
7/23/25, 6:28 PM - Person 2: Please advise the required width.
7/23/25, 6:28 PM - Person 4: 63”-74”
7/23/25, 6:29 PM - Person 4: 63”-64”
7/23/25, 6:48 PM - Person 2: <Media omitted>
7/23/25, 6:49 PM - Person 4: Price is very high
7/23/25, 6:49 PM - Person 4: Will not work
7/23/25, 6:50 PM - Person 4: This is more expensive than the single piece you are shipping
7/23/25, 6:55 PM - Person 2: The price is coming in the same line. 

 Also we have to run this only in 63" width looms.  So the production will come down.

Hope you understand.  

Thanks.
7/23/25, 6:59 PM - Person 4: What is the current width your running??
7/23/25, 7:01 PM - Person 2: 60"

11/26/25, 3:27 PM - Person 2: For 10000 meters, we planned minimum looms.  If the quantity is huge will increase additional looms.
11/26/25, 3:29 PM - Person 7: Okay, @⁨Person 4⁩ please tell him your final delivery date. If it works for all, then great. If not, then unfortunate. 

@⁨Person 2⁩ Trust you’re understanding that a deadline cannot and will not be shifted because of your thought process for minimum looms. We have a deadline to meet and will not incur overheads for you to squeeze extra margin. In that particular case, we can live without those SKUs and carry on with the rest of our business
